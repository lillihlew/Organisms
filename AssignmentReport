1 Cooperator 99 Defectors:
I think that the defectors will thrive since there are 99 of them. In the first 10 
iterations, all of the organisms will grow from 1 to 10 energy points, and during 
that tenth iteration, all of the organisms will reproduce. since there are so many more
defectors than cooperators, if the defectors reproduce and replace the cooperators
produced, then there will be no cooperators left. If the cooperators successfully 
reproduce even twice, though, I think they will win out after 100 iterations. I predict
that at the end there will either be all cooperators or all defectors, and more 
likely all defectors. Since the cooperators can work together, they reproduce much 
more quickly than the defectors, and can easily take over. The average of averages 
will be close to 1. The results supported my prediction perfectly, if the cooperators 
reproduced twice (like had more than 2 of them in the dish at once) then they took 
over and if they didn't reproduce twice they were wiped out. The average of averages
was 0.8, which fits my prediction.
After 100 ticks:
Cooperators = 0, 0, 0, 100, 100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0									Avg: 20
Defectors   = 100, 100, 100, 0, 0, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100						Avg: 80
Partial     = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0										Avg: 0
Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 Avg: .8


1 Defector 99 Cooperators
I  think that the defector will die out almost immediately, if not immediately.
Since the cooperators can work together, they can reproduce very quickly, whereas
it takes the defector ten updates to be able to reproduce. I've seen cooperators
get so much energy share that they'ree at 17 energy points before reproducing, meaning
that they got shared with at least 8 times in that update. So, I think every result
will be all cooperators at the end, and that the mean cooperation probability will always 
be 1. The results support my prediction perfectly because in each experiment, there were 
no defectors left. The average of averages was 1.
After 100 ticks for each of the ten iterations:
Cooperators = 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100					Avg: 100
Defectors   = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0										Avg: 0
Partial     = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0										Avg: 0
Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0		Avg: 1.0


1 Cooperator, 1 Defector, 98 Partial Cooperators
I think that it is most likely that partial cooperators will win out and be the 
only surviving species, but there is some probability of the sole cooperator being 
able to survive long enough to reproduce successfully, though I highly doubt that
would happen. The only way would be for most of the partial cooperators to act
as defectors for most of the time, which won't happen since they're written to 
work as cooperators 50% of the time. Cooperators, as I've said before, reproduce 
too quickly to give the defector a chance of surviving, and I doubt the sole
partial cooperator will last long since it doesn't have other partial cooperators 
to share energy with, so it would actually likely die within the first update.
The results supported my prediction perfectly: the partial cooperators won out 
each time and the average of averages was 0.5.
After 100 ticks for each of the ten iterations:
Cooperators = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0											Avg: 0
Defectors   = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0											Avg: 0
Partial     = 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100						Avg: 100
Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5		Avg: 0.5


33 Cooperators, 33 Defectors, 34 Partial Cooperators
I predict that there will be mostly cooperators and maybe a few partial cooperators 
after 100 iterations. The partial cooperators have a fighting chance this time since 
they have 33 helpers and can reproduce way more quickly with help. Otherwise, the 
cooperators will dominate. Either way, the defectors will die out very quickly. The
results almost support my prediction: the cooperators did dominate. However, it 
appears as though the partial cooperators could not last long enough to reproduce 
quickly enough to stay alive, and the cooperators overwhelmed them. The defectors 
all died out. The average of averages was 1.0.
After 100 ticks for each of the ten iterations:
Cooperators = 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100						Avg: 100
Defectors   = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0											Avg: 0
Partial     = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0											Avg: 0
Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0			Avg: 1.0


50 Cooperators, 25 Defectors, 25  Partial Cooperators
There is no chance of survival for anything but the cooperators. After the last
experiment when they were on an equal playing field and cooperators still won out,
there is no way that defectors or partial cooperators will survive this. The 
cooperators will reproduce and replace the partial cooperators and defectors before 
they will be able to reproduce. The results support my predictions perfectly, 
nothing put cooperators survived any of the experiments and the average of averages 
was 1.0.
After 100 ticks for each of the ten iterations:
Cooperators = 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100						Avg: 100
Defectors   = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0											Avg: 0
Partial     = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0											Avg: 0
Mean Cooperation Probability = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0			Avg: 1.0


What insights can you make regarding what lets cooperators succeed in this simulation versus go extinct?
In this experiment, I found that on an equal playing field (33 33 34), cooperators were 
the only organism capable of surviving 100 iterations of updates, and I think it is because 
of how quickly they can share energy. Since they can share energy so quickly, they are able 
to reproduce way more quickly than other organisms can, easily replacing them. Though, 
I must say, I think that the amount of starting helpers the cooperators have is an indicator 
of success as well. In an experiment with 99 defectors, the cooperator only won out 20% of 
the time, because it started alone and only successfully reproduced enough times to make a 
difference 20% of the time before being replaced with defectors. But, when there were 98 
partial cooperators, the partial cooperators won out over the cooperators, because they could 
grow from sharing energy with each other. In nature, I would expect partial cooperators
to be a much more prominent species since they reproduce so quickly, and I would expect
defectors to be very rare since they take a very long time to reproduce. I would expect 
a large-ish population of partial cooperators, but less than half as many of them as the
cooperators since they cannot reproduce even half as quickly. I ran a few of my own 
experiments and found that cooperators were able to completely dominate even when they
started with a population of 5 and partial cooperators started with a population of 95.
